LASHKRULI

This project is my final project for my Bachelor's Degree at Tbilisi State University (TSU). It good 100/100 points tho.
The main idea of this game is that it should be educational â€” itâ€™s based on Georgiaâ€™s history. Every chapter represents one century of Georgiaâ€™s past. So the enemies, environment, and all the elements reflect how things were during that time.

The game has many interesting mechanics I want to talk about. One of them is wall hang. This mechanic was really fun to work on, cuz it was my first time doing game dev. I had to figure out the logic for it â€” for example, if you hang on the wall for too long, your hero will drop down. You can also wall-jump, whether it's from one wall or bouncing between two.

The second most challenging part was the attack combo system. Ofc the first version of that was trash xd â€” it had tons of bugs and barely worked. After some research and brainstorming, I realized I needed to make transition animations and only allow attack inputs during those. It actually turned out pretty good (but yeah, it has one bug tho xd â€” if the enemy hits you while you're in the transition animation, the attack input gets stuck and doesn't work anymore ðŸ˜­).

During this journey I discovered how hard it is to make sprites. Thatâ€™s the main reason the backgrounds are generated by AI, but all the details, characters, and smaller sprites are made by me in Aseprite.

The game also has an economy system â€” you can find treasure, and coins can be spent to upgrade your health, attack damage, or speed. That part was actually really fun to build, tbh.

Right now, the game is in **demo** state. There are 6 levels (probably with bugs :D), and a lot still needs work â€” but Iâ€™m really proud of this project. It taught me a lot.
Maybe in the future Iâ€™ll continue working on it, but next time Iâ€™m definitely teaming up with a graphic designer, cuz I suck at making sprites.

This game also have particle systems: while walking on the grass, on jumping, damaging the enemy, killing the enemy, destroyinh the Health Item.
Lashkruli have Sound effects as well, such as enemies voice, slashing the sword, chest sound, SFX sounds and etc.
Game have mini map in level 6, cuz I missed the scales of the map and it is to big and mini map helps to orient yorself in the map.
